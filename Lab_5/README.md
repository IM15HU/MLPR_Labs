### Lab 5 

### Methadology 
    1 - Face Detection - Done using the Haar-cascades dataset (built into the OpenCV toolkit).
    2 - Feature Extraction - Extracted images were converted from BGR to the HSV colourspace. The features extracted were the mean hue and saturation of each face.
    3 - Clustering - was done with the KMeans clustering algorithm with a value of K = 2 .
    4 - Template Matching - A template image was processed using the same pipeline and assigned to the cluster to the centroid of which it was clostest to.
